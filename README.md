# Machine Learning: Ground Water Survey
## The above ML project uses numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn and linear regression(imported from scikit-learn library) method.
### The dataset is available at :- http://college.cengage.com/mathematics/brase/understandable_statistics/8e/students/datasets/slr/slr09.html
<p>This project predicts and checks the quality of groundwater. The model is trained on the basis of pH of water and bicarbonates(parts per million). </p>

<p> Linear regression is used to find the fit line through the plotted data. Explore the notebook. Fork and star the repo.</p>
